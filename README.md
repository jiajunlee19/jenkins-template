# Introduction
This repo demonstrate how to setup Jenkins using Docker.

<br>

### Installing Docker for Windows
1. Download the docker desktop installer from the Official Docker Website.
2. To specify custom path to install Docker, cd to the folder with the downloaded Docker Desktop Installer and run the below command in `CMD` as admin.
    ```
    start /w "" "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install -accept-license  --installation-dir="D:\Program Files (x86)\Docker" --wsl-default-data-root="D:\Program Files (x86)\Docker" 
    ```
3. Double-check if your user account is part of the `docker-users` group. Click Window+R and run `netplwiz`.
    - If not in the group, manually add your window user account into `docker-users` and re-login.
        ```
        net localgroup docker-users "your-user-id" /ADD
        ```
    - Ensure that `docker-users` have full permission in the installed Docker folder path.

4. If there's any wsl error encountered when running docker, try below steps. 
  - Disable these features by running below powershell commands as admin.
    ```
    DISM /Online /disable-Feature /FeatureName:VirtualMachinePlatform
    DISM /Online /disable-Feature /FeatureName:HypervisorPlatform
    DISM /Online /disable-Feature /FeatureName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
    ```
  - Restart your computer.
  - Re-enable those features by running below powershell commands as admin.
    ```
    DISM /Online /enable-Feature /FeatureName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
    DISM /Online /enable-Feature /FeatureName:VirtualMachinePlatform
    DISM /Online /enable-Feature /FeatureName:HypervisorPlatform
    ```


### Installing Jenkins using Docker
1. Create a bridge network in Docker
    ```
    docker network create jenkins
    ```

2. Build the docker image
    ```
    docker build -t myjenkins-blueocean:2.479.1-1 .
    ```

3. Run the docker image
    ```
    docker run --name jenkins-blueocean --restart=on-failure --detach --network jenkins --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2376 --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client --env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client:ro --publish 8080:8080 --publish 50000:50000 myjenkins-blueocean:2.479.1-1
    ```

4. Copy the initial jenkins admin password
    ```
    docker exec jenkins-blueocean cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```

5. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and unlock with the initialAdminPassword copied.

### Build your Jenkins Pipeline
1. Create a new pipeline in the jenkins UI.
2. Declare pipeline using repo's [Jenkinsfile](/jenkins/Jenkinsfile)
    - Generally the workflow of the pipeline will be:
        - [Install dependency](/jenkins/scripts/install.sh)
        - [Kill specific previous-deployed running shell process](/jenkins//scripts/kill.sh)
        - [Build the app](/jenkins/scripts/build.sh)
        - [Deploy the app and keep it running](/jenkins/scripts/deploy.sh)

3. Tips:
    - Use `withCredentials` to pass over .env file stored as credential secret file into workspace directory. 
        ```
        withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'youCredId', variable: 'envFile')]) {
            sh 'cp "$envFile" "$WORKSPACE"'
            echo "Copied envFile into $WORKSPACE !"
        }
        ```
    - Use `chmod` to make the sh script as executable
        ```
        sh 'chmod +x ./jenkins/scripts/deploy.sh'
        ```
    - Use `JENKINS_NODE_COOKIE` to stop background process to be killed after job completed
        ```
        sh JENKINS_NODE_COOKIE=dontKillMe ./jenkins/scripts/deploy.sh
        ```
3. Recommended options:
    - Do not allow concurrent builds and abort previous builds if new triggers came in
    - Preserve stashes from most recent completed build

4. Once the pipeline setup completed, configure webhooks to enable auto-triggering based on dedicated events.

# Using Dedicated Jenkins Agent (Windows)
1. Ensure that java is installed on the agent machine. Best to have the same version per the jenkins' controller. Current repo's java version is `jdk-17.0.13`.

2. Environment variables should be set based on the java installed path. Verify by running `java --version` in terminal.
    - %JAVA_HOME% = `path/to/jdk-17.0.13`
    - %PATH% = `%JAVA_HOME%/bin`

3. Create a folder and cd to it. This is the workspace for the agent.
    ```
    cd path\to\your-agent-label
    ```

4. Download the agent.jar, substitute the variables accordingly.
    ```
    curl.exe -sO ${your_jenkins_url}/jnlpJars/agent.jar
    ```

5. Initiate the agent connection, substitute the variables accordingly.
    ```
    java -jar agent.jar -url ${your_jenkins_url} -secret ${your_agent_secret} -name ${your_agent_label} -webSocket -workDir ${your_path_to_agent_set_in_step_3}
    ```

6. Update your pipeline to run with the agent.
    ```
    agent {
        node {
            label 'your-agent-label'
        }
    }
    ```

7. Ensure that your agent has all the prior dependencies installed and available.
    - Relevant application (eg: Git, NodeJS) needs to be installed in the agent machine.
    - Relevant environment variables (eg: Proxy, Certificate Path) need to be set accordingly in the agent machine.

8. Advance Tips: Consider skipping Step #7 by using Docker to containerize all the related setup required for consistency across several agents.
    - Checkout the commands in [dockerize.sh](/jenkins/scripts/dockerize.sh)
